# AssayScreeningDataProcessor
Processes assay screening data outputted from Perkin-Elmer Envision plate readers for compatibility to upload into a database for further analyses and comparisons across experiments.

This script is intended to provide users with an easy-to-use interface and to automate processing and converting raw data from plate readers amenable to upload to a database.

This processor also provides a plate summary spreadsheet that summarizes statistical information: high/low control averages, standard deviations, z' scores, etc. to help assess assay quality across all plates run. The processor was intended for use in high-throughput screening assays.
